As an **Occupational Health & Safety Consultant** with a passion for **data-driven strategies**, I help companies protect their most valuable asset: their people.

With a background in **Industrial Engineering** and years of experience managing health programs, coordinating medical teams, and analyzing large workforce databases, I bridge technical expertise with real human impact.

I thrive in structured environments, love improving processes, and believe that **prevention is the smartest investment** a company can make. I also enjoy mentoring others and building strong, purpose-driven collaborations—especially where **health, safety, and sustainability** meet.

> Let’s create workplaces where people thrive! 🌿
