# Predictive Maintenance Dashboard – Occupational Health Equipment

This project simulates a predictive maintenance system for critical occupational health equipment such as audiometers, spirometers, and vision screeners. The goal is to identify failure patterns and optimize preventive actions using a Power BI dashboard and data-driven insights.

## 🔧 Project Overview

- **Domain:** Occupational Health / Maintenance Analytics  
- **Tools:** Power BI, Excel, Power Query  
- **Techniques:** Data transformation, failure analysis, KPI tracking

## 📁 Dataset Summary

A simulated dataset of 300+ maintenance records for medical equipment across three clinics.

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Equipment_ID | Unique identifier for each equipment |
| Equipment_Type | Type of medical device |
| Facility_Name | Name of the facility where equipment is located |
| Installation_Date | Equipment installation date |
| Last_Maintenance | Date of last preventive maintenance |
| Failure_Date | Date when a failure occurred (if any) |
| Failure_Type | Type of failure (electrical, wear and tear, etc.) |
| Downtime_Hours | Equipment downtime in hours |
| Repair_Cost_USD | Cost of repair in USD |
| Next_Maintenance_Due | Scheduled next preventive maintenance |
| Technician_Name | Person responsible for maintenance |
| Days_Since_Last_PM | Days since the last preventive maintenance |
| Failure_Flag | Binary indicator (1 = failure, 0 = no failure) |

## 📊 Dashboard Features

- Failure trends by equipment type and clinic
- KPI cards: % of on-time maintenance, average repair cost, mean downtime
- Visual alerts for overdue maintenance
- Failure probability analysis based on PM gaps

## 🧠 Insights (To be added after dashboard creation)

> Key takeaways from the data will be presented here once the dashboard is built.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- [ ] Design Power BI dashboard with relevant visuals
- [ ] Add failure probability logic (optionally using Python or Power Query)
- [ ] Upload .pbix file to this repository
- [ ] Record a short walkthrough video (optional)
